# Lo Be Story — Interactive Website Strategy

## The Brief

Create a fun, game-like interactive website for lo-be-story.com that lets visitors *experience* the Narrative by Design methodology — not just read about it. The site should feel as bold and playful as the "How Katy Perry Are You?" reference, but deliver real value by demonstrating how narrative compression works.

## What Makes the Katy Perry Site Work (Design Anatomy)

Before we design anything, it's worth naming exactly *why* that simple quiz feels so engaging:

**1. Zero friction entry.** No instructions, no sign-up, no explanation. You land and you're already playing. The first screen is already a choice — HOT or COLD. That's it.

**2. Binary simplicity.** Every screen is exactly two words. Left or right. The visual language is so clear you don't even need to be told what to do. Filled text = one energy. Outlined text = the other. Click and move on.

**3. Accumulating identity.** Each choice quietly builds a profile. You don't feel like you're being assessed — you feel like you're expressing yourself. The "game" is really just structured self-reflection disguised as play.

**4. Big reveal with personality.** The result screen doesn't give you a number on a dashboard. It gives you an *attitude* — "FIGHT AND BREAK UP. YOU ARE ONLY 33% KATY PERRY..." It's emotional, funny, shareable.

**5. Typography IS the interface.** No buttons, no cards, no UI chrome. The words themselves are the interaction. This is the key design insight — when you strip away everything else, language becomes the experience.

That last point is what makes this reference so perfect for Lo Be Story. Your entire methodology is about the *power of words* — compressing experience down to one word that changes everything. The website should make visitors feel that power firsthand.

## Your Secret Weapon: The Methodology Itself

Most service businesses have to *invent* a gimmick for their website. You don't. The Narrative by Design process is already inherently interactive:

- It starts with *too many words* (the messy paragraph)
- It compresses through stages (paragraph → sentence → keyword)
- It ends with *one word* that reframes everything

That compression arc IS the game. We just need to present it in a way that feels like play, not homework.

## The Concept: "WHAT'S YOUR ONE WORD?"

### The Big Idea

A full-screen, typography-driven interactive experience where visitors go through a miniature version of narrative compression — making a series of fast, instinctive choices that progressively narrow down to reveal their "one word." The result page explains what that word means, how it connects to their choices, and introduces Lo Be Story's methodology.

Think of it as: **Katy Perry quiz mechanics × Narrative by Design methodology × bold minimal design.**

### How It Flows

**SCREEN 1 — The Hook**
Full screen. Big type. One line:

> WHAT'S YOUR ONE WORD?

Subtitle: *"Tap to find out."*

No nav. No logo yet. Just curiosity.

---

**SCREENS 2–7 — The Binary Choices (6 rounds)**

Each screen presents two opposing words. The visitor picks one. Just like the Katy Perry site — left or right, filled vs. outlined.

But here's the twist: instead of random pop culture opposites, each pair maps to one of the three Narrative by Design dimensions:

| Round | Pair | Dimension |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | BUILD / DISCOVER | Values |
| 2 | LEAD / SUPPORT | Strengths |
| 3 | CREATE / ANALYZE | Skills |
| 4 | DEPTH / BREADTH | Values |
| 5 | SPEAK / LISTEN | Strengths |
| 6 | STRUCTURE / FLOW | Skills |

The visual treatment shifts subtly with each round — background color warms gradually (cool gray → soft amber → warm coral), making the experience feel like it's *heating up* as you narrow in.

---

**SCREEN 8 — The Compression Moment**

This is the payoff. Instead of an immediate result, we add one beat of drama:

The screen shows ALL six words the user picked, scattered across the screen in different sizes. Then they animate — shrinking, converging, overlapping — until they compress into **ONE WORD** at the center of the screen.

The word is algorithmically selected from a curated set based on their combination of choices. Examples:

- BUILD + LEAD + CREATE + DEPTH + SPEAK + STRUCTURE → **"ARCHITECT"**
- DISCOVER + SUPPORT + ANALYZE + BREADTH + LISTEN + FLOW → **"NAVIGATOR"**
- BUILD + SUPPORT + CREATE + DEPTH + LISTEN + STRUCTURE → **"CRAFTSPERSON"**
- DISCOVER + LEAD + CREATE + BREADTH + SPEAK + FLOW → **"CATALYST"**

Each word has a short, resonant description beneath it.

---

**SCREEN 9 — The Reveal + Education**

Now the site earns the right to explain itself. Below the result:

> *"You just experienced narrative compression — the core of what we do at Lo Be Story."*

A brief, punchy explanation:
> *"We help people move from everything they could say... to the one thing that matters. That one word isn't a label. It's a lens — a way to decide what to emphasize, what to cut, and how to tell a story that actually lands."*

Then a soft CTA:
> **"Want to find your real one word? Let's talk."**

And a secondary CTA:
> *"Or see how we did this for Dartmouth →"*

---

### Why This Works as a Business Tool

**For first-time visitors:** They experience the methodology before they understand it. By the time they read the explanation, they've already felt the "aha" of compression. It's not a pitch — it's proof.

**For potential clients (universities, orgs):** The case study link to Dartmouth grounds the playfulness in credibility. They see the fun AND the substance.

**For sharing/virality:** The result is inherently shareable — "I'm an ARCHITECT. What's your one word?" This is the same mechanic that makes personality quizzes spread. Except this one actually teaches something.

## Design Language

### What to borrow from the Katy Perry site:
- Full-screen, no-chrome typography as the entire UI
- Binary left/right choice mechanic
- Bold, oversized type (80–120px+)
- Scrolling marquee ticker at the bottom (but with Lo Be Story branding)
- The confidence of showing NOTHING except the choice

### What to evolve:
- **Color progression** instead of flat pink — the background subtly shifts as you go deeper into compression (representing the journey from chaos to clarity)
- **The compression animation** on the result screen — this is the moment the Katy Perry site doesn't have. It's where your methodology comes alive visually.
- **Two typography modes** — outlined (not chosen) vs. filled (chosen), just like the reference, but using a more refined serif/sans pairing that fits Lo Be Story's brand
- **A meaningful result** — not just a percentage, but a *word* with a description that feels genuinely insightful

### Typography suggestion:
- Headlines: A bold display serif (like the Playfair Display from v1, or something more editorial like Freight Display or Canela)
- The word pairs: A heavy sans-serif in all caps (like the Katy Perry site uses), but with more polish — something like Instrument Sans, Space Grotesk, or Syne
- Body/explanations: Clean sans (Inter)

### Color palette:
- Start: Light cool gray (#F2F0ED)
- Mid-game: Warm sand (#E8DDD0)
- Result reveal: Soft coral or amber (#D4886B or #C4956A)
- Text: Near-black (#1A1A1A) and white
- Accent: One signature color for the "one word" reveal

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: The Interactive Quiz Experience (the game)
Build the 9-screen interactive flow described above. This IS the website. When you go to lo-be-story.com, you land directly in the experience. No traditional homepage first.

### Phase 2: The "After" Layer
After completing the quiz, visitors can scroll down (or navigate) to learn more:
- About Lo Be Story (brief, confident, minimal)
- The Dartmouth case study
- Contact / booking

### Phase 3: Share & Track
- Shareable result cards (auto-generated OG images for social sharing)
- Simple analytics to track which words are most common
- Optional email capture: "Want a deeper version of this exercise? Drop your email."

## What This Replaces

The current v1 site I built you is a solid, professional landing page — but it's generic. It could be any brand consultancy. This interactive approach makes lo-be-story.com *feel* like Lo Be Story. The medium IS the message: a website about narrative compression that literally compresses your narrative in real time.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Align on the concept** — Does this direction feel right? Any word pairs or result words you'd want to change?
2. **Build the prototype** — I can build the full interactive experience as a single HTML file
3. **Refine the content** — Dial in the word-pair mappings, result descriptions, and educational copy
4. **Ship it** — Deploy to lo-be-story.com
